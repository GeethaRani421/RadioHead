RadioHead Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors
===========================================================

This is a fork of the original RadioHead Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors. It provides a complete object-oriented library for sending and receiving packetized messages via a variety of common data radios and other transports on a range of embedded microprocessors.

Please read the full documentation and licensing from the original author [site][3]

Since I sometime need to add custom (Example for [ULPNode][6]) features to the lib but keep it in sync with the original one, I've got 2 repo:    

- My master one https://github.com/hallard/RadioHead that is the one you need if you want to use my projects or lib added features. Then I 
- forked it to https://github.com/ch2i/RadioHead where I put the original version released by the author.


Like this I can do Pull request from [ch2i][4] to [hallard][1] to add new features added by the author to my version.

This mean that this [one][4] is just a git version the latest original done by Mike, I don't do any change on this one.

I know it's not the best way, but I didn't found a better solution for now, if you have better idea, just let me know

So this is my current [version][1] 
and the original .
