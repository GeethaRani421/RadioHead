RadioHead Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors
===========================================================

This is a fork of the original RadioHead Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors. It provides a complete object-oriented library for sending and receiving packetized messages via a variety of common data radios and other transports on a range of embedded microprocessors.

Please read the full documentation and licensing from the original author [site][3], here it's just a copy to keep in sync my custom forked [version][1] with [original version][4].
