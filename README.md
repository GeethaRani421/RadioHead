===========================================================		
		
###Version 1.67

This is a copy of the original RadioHead Packet Radio library for embedded microprocessors. It provides a complete object-oriented library for sending and receiving packetized messages via a variety of common data radios and other transports on a range of embedded microprocessors.		
		
Please read the full documentation and licensing from the original author [site][3], here it's just a copy to keep in sync my custom featured [version][1] with this [original version][4].		

**If you want to know what features have been added for my custom needs, please see my [repo version README][1]**
